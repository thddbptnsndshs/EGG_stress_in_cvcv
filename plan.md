# Classes

## Class 1: Typology of stress systems

- What is prosody about: tone, pitch accent and stress (we focus on stress)
- Key properties of stress -- obligatoriness and culminativity, contrast between stress and tone as prosodic properties of strings
- Examples of tonal/pitch accent/free-stress/stress languages (the continuum)
- What stress can count -- nuclei, syllables, moras and feet
- Two approaches to stress placement: metrical theory and primary-accent-first theory (foot structure vs assigning primary accent first)
- Possible reading: van der Hulst, H. (2009). Brackets and grid marks, or theories of primary accent and rhythm. Contemporary views on architecture and representations in phonological theory, 225-245.

## Class 2--3: Strict CV and stress as empty CVs

- Two levels: syllable structure and melody with a potential to associate
- Technicalities: government, licensing, representation of syllable weight and vowel/consonant length by 2 nuclei
- CV as an exponent of stress (Ségéral & Scheer 2008)
- Advantages of collapsing length and stress: case studies from Italian (Larsen 1998), Saami (Enguehard 2014) or Moksha (might save it for the Uralic phonology class)
- Summary of stress-related phenomena: vowel lengthening, consonant lengthening, aspiration, glottalization and tones
- How the paucity of stress-related phenomena is explained in OT (Giavazzi 2010)
- Exponents of stress: summary of diagnostics for when stress-as-length makes sense

## Classes 4--5: More intricate connection between weight and stress

- Problematic data where complex weight hierarchies are observed
- The happy marriage between grid theories of stress and Strict CV, i.e. Strict CV Metrics
- Projection and incorporation: the parameters and the systems they generate
- Possible reading: Ulfsbjorninn, S. (????) Weight hierarchies, Syllabification and Quantitative Meter: Strict CV Metrics as an alternative to Standard Moraic Theory [Ms.] (if I receive permission to use it from the author, since I obtained the text from someone who emailed Shanti for it. I really hope I will. Might find other texts on the same topic)
- Case study -- Russian stress: its place in the typology of metrical theory and van der Hulst's theory, an attempt at incorporation analysis
- Segue into boundaries

## Class 5: Boundaries and stress

- Why the CV boundary (Scheer 2012)
- The case of Old Norse (Enguehard 2015)
- Russian stress and the stress shift: can the CV boundary help? 
- Stress in phrases: how can we instantiate boundaries that separate domains of stress assignment?
- The procedural way (spellout domains as domains of stress assignment) and the representational way (boundary CVs as stress) 
- Spellout domains matter for prosody, word-internally as well (Marvin 2002)
