# Classes

## Class 1: Typology of stress systems

- What rules can determine stress in general: word accent and rhythm
- Formal approaches to typology of stress: metrical theory and primary-accent-first theory
- Is stress counting or not?
- Possible reading: van der Hulst, H. (2009). Brackets and grid marks, or theories of primary accent and rhythm. Contemporary views on architecture and representations in phonological theory, 225-245.

## Class 2: Strict CV and stress as empty CVs

- Two levels: syllable structure and melody with a potential to associate
- Representation of syllable weight and vowel/consonant length by 2 CVs
- Advantages of collapsing length and stress: case studies from Italian (Larsen 1998) and Moksha (might save it for the Uralic phonology class)

## Classes 3--4: More intricate connection between weight and stress

- Problematic data where complex weight hierarchies are observed
- The happy marriage between grid theories of stress and Strict CV, i.e. Strict CV Metrics
- Projection and incorporation: the parameters and the systems they generate
- Possible reading: Ulfsbjorninn, S. (????) Weight hierarchies, Syllabification and Quantitative Meter: Strict CV Metrics as an alternative to Standard Moraic Theory [Ms.] (if I receive permission to use it from the author, since I obtained the text from someone who emailed Shanti for it. I really hope I will. Might find other texts on the same topic)
- Case study -- Russian stress: its place in the typology of metrical theory and van der Hulst's theory, my attempts at modelling it with empty-CV-as-stress, an attempt at incorporation analysis
- Segue into boundaries and stress

## Class 5: Boundaries and stress

- Russian stress and the stress shift: can the CV boundary help? 
- Stress in phrases: how can we instantiate boundaries that separate domains of stress assignment?
- The procedural way (spellout domains as domains of stress assignment) and the representational way (boundary CVs as stress)
